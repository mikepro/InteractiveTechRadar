InteractiveTechRadar
====================

This is my attempt at creating a Interactive Tech Radar inspired by thoughtworks http://www.thoughtworks.com/radar using clever maths, svg and the superheroic powers of angularjs.
Okay so the maths isnt that clever just basic trignomotry that I have tried to teach myself.

Background
====================
I really like the Tech Radar format that thoughtworks produce.  I can go to one place and see all the new technologies that are comming out and decided if any would be of intrest to me.  What I wanted was to use the same format to display what im using, what im trialing.  I started looking for a tool to do this but could not find anything that suited my needs so I created this project.

This is very much still a work in progress.  There are quite a few features I have yet to implement and there are areas of the code I would like to improve. So please dont judge me to harshly YET.
